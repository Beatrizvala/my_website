# About Portugal...

Portugal is one of Europe’s oldest extant nations, an ancient kingdom defended by hilltop castles and dramatic walled towns. When you travel to Portugal for the first time you will most likely be struck by the friendliness of the people, affordable food and wine, and the diversity of a country that is relatively easy to travel around in just a few days.


It is a landscape of beaches and high mountains, but also of deep, verdant valleys and rolling hills dotted with stone-built villages. For generations, families have eked out a living from the land. The steeply terraced vineyards of the mountainous north contrasts with the cork oak plantations which dominate the vast agricultural plains of the south – roamed by wild boar.


The Portuguese have embraced contemporary life without getting rid of the more appealing aspects of previous centuries. Fully wired town centres have wi-fi hotspots, but they also have a butcher, a baker and (quite literally) a candle-stick maker. Every community has an ancient church, and while support for the institutions of the Church may have waned, a belief in traditional values remains. Children will be both seen and heard at any time of the day or night, as the family remains at the centre of most things.

# Where to go in Portugal...

From cliff-backed coves to endless stretches of sandy dunes, you’re rarely far from a stunning beach when you visit Portugal. Surfers are drawn to the consistent waves on the west coast, around **Ericeira** and **Peniche**, for example, while the calmer waters of the southern **Algarve** offer the quintessential laidback beach experience, such as around **Albufeira** and the **Ilha de Tavira**.

An epic coast is only part of the story. The green interior offers endless possibilities, from touring wine estates to walking, cycling or kayaking down its many rivers. Hilltop castles and ancient walled villages await, such as **Marvão**, **Monsaraz** and beautiful **Belmonte**.

That’s before you’ve discovered one of Europe’s most captivating capitals, **Lisbon**. While its cobbled streets, ancient trams, old-fashioned shops and traditional fado bars lend the city a timeless quality, a wealth of top museums, modern architecture and hot new bars and clubs have propelled it into the twenty-first century.

Then there’s **Porto**, rising up from the banks of the river Douro. Portugal’s second city is wonderfully atmospheric, particularly around the **Ribeira**, with its string of colourful buildings lining the waterfront and steep cobbled alleys. And a trip along the port wine route along the Rio Douro, lined with vineyards on the steep river banks, is not to be missed.



## 10 best places in Portugal

### Porto’s Ribeira

The colourful and characterful **Cais da Ribeira** was awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site status for obvious reasons. Multi-coloured buildings housing lively cafes and restaurants line the riverside, while meandering medieval streets and steep cobbled alleys that lead off the promenade beckon you to explore further. Take in the view across the Douro to the port wine lodges on the other side, while sipping a *galão* at a *café* on the promenade. Or come for a fresh fish dinner in the evening when the area is particularly lively.

### Sintra

Once a favoured summer retreat for Portugal’s royals enticed by the cooler air and picturesque surrounds, the hilltop town of **Sintra** is one of Portugal’s major attractions with UNESCO World Heritage kudos. Less than an hour’s drive from Lisbon it makes for a wonderful day trip, but to really appreciate the lavish palaces and fabulous gardens scattered within the lush wooded hills, give yourself two to three days to explore.

### Serra da Estrela

The lesser-trodden trails of the highest mountains in Portugal are a delight for the adventurous hiker. Routes in the **Parque Natural da Serra da Estrela** take in historic villages and remote stone churches, waterfalls and cork forests, windswept rocky plateaus and stupendous views. Try the *Queijo Serra da Estrela*, a wonderful gooey cheese made with sheep’s milk, specific to the region.

### Praia da Bordeira in the Algarve

This secluded beach on the west coast has a huge stretch of soft sand facing the force of the ocean. Backed by giant dunes and rugged, dusty hills, **Praia da Bordeira** is a spectacular spot. Kids splash about in the lagoon created by a gentle river at one end of the beach, while surfers are enticed by the powerful Atlantic swell and its immense waves.

### River Douro valley

Taking a trip along the **Rio Douro** ranks among the best journeys in Europe. Going by boat gives you wonderful views of the terraced vineyards and orange groves on the river banks, while driving lets you stop at your leisure and enjoy overnight stays in rural quintas (country estates). But taking the train is maybe the best way to combine a relaxing experience with fantastic views and stopoffs to some of Portugal’s best wineries. The ride from **Porto** to **Pocinho** near the Spanish border is particularly outstanding.

### Feira de Barcelos market

You could easily pass by the small town of **Barcelos**, not realising that on Thursdays the place comes alive with one of the best open-air markets in Europe, held since medieval times. You’ll find everything, from fruit and veg, cured meats and regional cheeses, cheap clothes and crafts. If you’re looking to take home some of the *loucas de Barcelos*, (local white and yellow pottery), traditional basketry and other crafts, you’re in the right place.

### Monsaraz

This tiny, sparsely inhabited, medieval village near the Spanish border sits high above the flat Alentejan plain of vineyards and olive groves. The castle is the big draw of **Monsaraz**, with its jumble of streets and awesome views of the plain and the **Alqueva reservoir**, but take the time to wander the village’s charming narrow cobbled streets of whitewashed cottages and browse the handicraft shops.

### Coimbra

The medieval city of Coimbra sitting above the **Rio Mondego** is home to Portugal’s oldest university, dating from 1290 – its star attraction being a splendid Baroque library. The old town exudes historical charm and, during term time, a liveliness generated by the student population – in the many bars, cafés and restaurants. You can hear *fado* music year round, but catching an open-air summer performance, the strains of guitar and male voices reverberating against the walls in the old town, is far more atmospheric.

### Alfama, Lisbon

Lisbon’s oldest and most atmospheric quarter is a delight of tangled narrow streets and alleys cutting across the slopes underneath the city’s Moorish castle. Here the hubbub of daily life happens minus the glitz of tourism. Kids play in the alleyways below laundry hanging from cast iron balconies, and the smell of fresh fish cooking hangs in the air. **Alfama** is also home to some of the city’s best fado bars and clubs.

### Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês

**Parque Nacional da Peneda-Gerês** is Portugal’s only national park, its 700 square kilometres covering steep forests of pine and birch, lush valleys, windblown plateaus strewn with odd rock formations and lovely rustic villages where ancient traditions are a part of everyday life. Hiker’s will delight in the numerous trails, ranging from short strolls to day-treks in the wildest remotest corners of the park.


# Cuisine in Portugal

Portuguese food doesn’t have the same high profile as other European cuisines, with menus usually relying on a traditional repertoire of grilled fish and meat, hearty stews and casseroles, and the ubiquitous salted cod (*bacalhau*), nearly all served with the same trio of accompaniments – rice, potatoes and salad. There are, of course, blindingly good exceptions to the norm in every town – **crispy suckling pig** from the local grill house, **sardines** straight from the boat and slapped on the barbecue, a **slow-cooked ragout** of wild boar in a country tavern – and these are the kind of simple, earthy dishes that Portugal excels in. Most restaurants are also extremely good value, while **Portuguese wine** (and not just the famous port) enjoys a growing worldwide reputation – if you’re not yet familiar with them, you’ll soon come to relish a refreshing glass of vinho verde on a hot day, or a gutsy Alentejo red with your grilled meat.
