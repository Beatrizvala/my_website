To understand the movements of the Portuguese Real Estate Market, let's look at the movements of the Residential properties' prices and compare it with the movements in the UK.

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(here)
library(readxl)
```



```{r}
Residential_data <- read_excel('C:\\Users\\beatr\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\Residential Property Prices.xls')


```

```{r}
 Residential_data_new <- Residential_data %>%  
  rename("%_change" = `Residential Property Prices, Percent Change, Annual, Not Seasonally Adjusted`, "residential_prices" = `Residential Property Prices, Index 2010=100, Annual, Not Seasonally Adjusted`)


```

## Plots

```{r}
plot1r <- Residential_data_new %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `observation_date`, y = `%_change`, color = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black", "grey50")) +
  labs(x = "Observation date", y = "% change in residential prices", title = "% change in residential prices in Portugal and in the UK")

plot1r
```


```{r}
plot2r <- Residential_data_new %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `observation_date`, y = `residential_prices`, color = Country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black", "grey50")) +
  labs(x = "Observation date", y = "Residential prices", title = "Residential prices in Portugal and in the UK", subtitle = "Index 2010 = 100")

plot2r
```

As we can see residential prices in Portugal have been having relatively high positive changes in prices, in particular, comparing to the UK. Which means that at least until Coronavirus appeared, this market was thriving and had good investment opportunities.
