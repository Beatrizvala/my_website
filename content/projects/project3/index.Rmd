Let's look at how Coronavirus has been developing in Portugal, comparing it with the UK and with the whole world.

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(here)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
covid_data <- read_excel('C:\\Users\\beatr\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\owid-covid-data.xlsx')

```

```{r}
covid_data_new <- covid_data %>% 
  transform.data.frame(`date` = as.Date(`date`))

```

## Plots

```{r}
plot1c <- covid_data_new %>%
  filter(`location` == "Portugal") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `date`, y = `total_cases`, color = `location`)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 month") +
  geom_line() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = "grey50") +
  labs(y = "Total number of cases", x = "Date", title = "Total number of Covid-19 cases in Portugal")

plot1c
```


```{r}
plot2c <- covid_data_new %>%
  filter(`location` == c("Portugal", "United Kingdom", "World")) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `date`, y = `total_cases_per_million`, color = `location`)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "2 month") +
  geom_line() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("grey50", "black", "white")) +
  labs(y = "Total cases per million", x = "Date", title = "Total number of Covid-19 cases in Portugal, UK and World")

plot2c
```

As we can see from both graphs, the total cases in Portugal have been evolving rapidly, in particular in the past days. Besides, the UK was able to control the cases between June and September, whereas in Portugal during these months the total cases continued to rise at a fast rate.
