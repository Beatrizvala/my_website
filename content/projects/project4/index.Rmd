Portugal has a strong wine tradition, and the excellent quality of its wines is recognized all over the world.
Let's see the total wine production in Portugal!

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center")
```

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(here)
library(readxl)
```



```{r}
Wine_data <- read_excel('C:\\Users\\beatr\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\Wine.xls')

```


```{r}
 Wine_data_new <- Wine_data %>%
  rename("Wine_production_hl" = `Wine production (hectolitre)`) %>% 
  transform.data.frame(`Year` = as.numeric(as.character(`Year`)),
                      `Wine_production_hl`= as.numeric(as.character(`Wine_production_hl`)))

```

## Plots

```{r}
plot1w <- Wine_data_new %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Year`, y = `Wine_production_hl`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~ Localization, scales = "free_y") + 
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  labs(y = "Wine production (hl)", title = "Wine production in Portugal")
  

plot1w
```

As expected the wine production in Portuguese Mainland is much higher than on the islands. Besides, the total production has been relatively stable in the Mainland (about over 6M hl per year). In Azores the production is quite unstable and is the island with the smallest contribution to this market.
