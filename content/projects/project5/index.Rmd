# Where to go in Portugal...

If you are looking to go to the beach with a calm sea and enjoy the sun, the best place to go is **Algarve**, located in the south. And for surfers, looking for big waves **Ericeira** and **Peniche** are amazing places to visit and stay for a couple of days..

**Lisbon** is a beautiful and captivating city to visit. It is really traditional, but also full of modern architecture. Some of the go-to areas are Chiado, Terreiro do Paço, Alfama and Avenida da Liberdade.

**Porto** is almost the second capital of Portugal. There you can find the **Ribeira**, surrounded by colorful buildings rising up from the banks of the river Douro. Along Douro are located some of the world's most incredible vineyards and doing a trip along the port wine route is one of the best parts of visiting Portugal.
