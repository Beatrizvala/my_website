Tourism accounts for a big portion of Portugal's GDP, being a sector with high importance for the country.
Let's see how this market is evolving.

```{r, setup, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  message = FALSE, 
  warning = FALSE, 
  tidy=FALSE,     # display code as typed
  size="small")   # slightly smaller font for code
options(digits = 3)

# default figure size
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width=6.75, 
  fig.height=6.75,
  fig.align = "center")
```

```{r load-libraries, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(here)
library(readxl)
```


```{r}
Tourism_data1 <- read_excel('C:\\Users\\beatr\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\tourismv02.xls')


Tourism_data2 <- read_excel('C:\\Users\\beatr\\OneDrive\\Ambiente de Trabalho\\tourism.xls')

```

```{r}
 Tourism_data1_new <- Tourism_data1 %>%  
  rename("Place_of_residence" = `Place of residence (Country - short list)`,
         "Year" = `Data reference period`,
         "Number_of_nights" = `Nights (No.) in tourist accommodation establishments by Geographic localization and Place of residence (Country - short list); Annual (1)`) %>%
  transform.data.frame(`Year` = as.numeric(as.character(`Year`)))

```


```{r}
 Tourism_data2_new <- Tourism_data2 %>%  
  rename("Accomodation_type" = `Accomodation type`,
         "Overnight_stays" = `Overnight stays`,
         "Accomodation_type" = `Accomodation type`) %>%
  transform.data.frame(`Year` = as.numeric(as.character(`Year`)),
                       `Overnight_stays` = as.numeric(as.character(`Overnight_stays`)))

```

## Plots

```{r}
plot1t <- Tourism_data1_new %>% 
  filter(Place_of_residence == "Total") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Year`, y = `Number_of_nights`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                  colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  labs(y = "Number of nights", title = "Number of nights in Portuguese tourist accommodation establishments")

plot1t
```

As we can see the number of nights spent in tourist accommodation establishments per year has been increasingly higher, which is great for Portugal's economy as well as for our culture. However, given the situation we are currently living in, there will certainly be a decrease in 2020 and 2021, which I hope we can solve fast.

```{r}
plot2t <- Tourism_data2_new %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = `Year`, y = `Overnight_stays`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ Accomodation_type, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "lightblue",
                                colour = "lightblue",
                                size = 0.5, linetype = "solid")) +
  labs(y = "Overnight stays", title = "Number of nights in colective tourist accomodations")

plot2t
```

With these graphs we can look to several types of collective tourist accommodations. In particular, hotels and rural tourism have been the main drivers of the increase of overnight stays in these accommodations, showing an upward slope. Whereas overnight stays in holiday camps have been decreasing year by year.
