<p>My name is Beatriz and I am from Portugal (as you already know) where I was born and raised.</p>
<div id="academic-background" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Background</h2>
<p>I did my Bachelors in <strong>Business Management</strong> at Católica Lisbon and currently I am doing the <strong>Masters in Financial Analysis</strong> at London Business School, which made me move to <strong>London</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="professional-experience" class="section level2">
<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
<p>Right after my Bachelors I started working at <strong>Deloitte in the Financial Advisory</strong> department and I was allocated to the Real Estate team. I stayed there for 9 months and it was a highly enriching experience.</p>
<p>Besides Deloitte, I have already gained some professional experience at my family’s business. My family owns a Coffee Shop Retailer in Portugal and I am part of the <strong>Family Advisory Board</strong> that we created so that all of us could be up to date and provide several inputs for the company.</p>
</div>
<div id="volunteering-experiences" class="section level2">
<h2>Volunteering Experiences</h2>
<p>During my studies at Católica-Lisbon I volunteered as a <strong>catechist</strong> for 3 years. For the first 2 years, the kids in my class were between 5 and 7 years old and in the last year my class had kids with around 14 years old.
I really enjoyed this experience and it was a great way for me to develop my leadership and organizational skills.</p>
</div>
<div id="hobbies" class="section level2">
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p><strong>Horse riding</strong> is one of my biggest passions since I was 10 years old and my favorite activity to do when I have free time. To me horse riding is like therapy. Whenever I am feeling nervous or sad, nothing helps me relax more than being in contact with horses and going for delightful big walks. So, when I have a free afternoon, I love going horse riding with my friends and sharing these feelings and emotions with them.</p>
<p><strong>Traveling</strong> is my other passion. I love getting to know all kinds of places, from big cities to developing countries. For me, the best thing about traveling is to meet different cultures and different people and to see places able to take my breath away. The best trip I made was in the end of my exchange semester, when I traveled with my friends around Southeast Asia for a month. It was an incredible experience: We ate scorpions, slept on night buses and spent nights in tents. I learned a lot during this experience and it definitely made me grow.</p>
